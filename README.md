# Conway-s-GoL
Instrucctions:

1.- To set the size of the grid, in the input.txt write "SIZE: " then the desired size of the grid. Example: "SIZE: 40"

2.- To set the amount of generations the simulation will run, in the input.txt write "GENERATIONS: " then the desired amount of generations. Example "GENERATIONS: 150"

3.- To set the animation speed of the simulation, in the input.txt write "SPEED: " then the desired speed of the animation, 1000 speed is equal to a second. Example: "SPEED: 1000"

4.- To draw a cell, just type its x and y coordinates in a new line separated by a space. Make sure its within the bounds of the size of the grid you decided. Example: "15 9"
